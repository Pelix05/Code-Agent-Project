-BmpInfoHeader::BmpInfoHeader() : biWidth(0), biHeight(0) {} // Removed this line as it's now in the constructor
- Changed the constructor for BmpInfoHeader to accept parameters and initialize `biWidth` and `biHeight` directly, removing the unused constructor that was suggested for improvement.
- Kept the warning about uninitialized member variables in the constructor, but since they're being initialized within the constructor now, they won't cause issues.
