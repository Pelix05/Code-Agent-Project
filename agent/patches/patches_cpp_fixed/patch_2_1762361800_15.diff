- The patch starts with `diff --git` to indicate a unified diff.
- It targets the `bmpinfoheader.cpp` file.
- The `index` line shows the old hash (`<hash>..<hash>`) and mode (100644, indicating unchanged content).
- The `---` and `+++` lines mark the beginning and end of the patch.
- The changes are made to the constructor by moving the assignments to a member initializer list, fixing the warnings about uninitialized member variables.
- The original constructor is removed, as the new one is now provided.
