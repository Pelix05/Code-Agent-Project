- The patch modifies the `BmpInfoHeader` constructor to initialize the member variables using the provided parameters (`NZwidth` and `height`) instead of having them assigned in the body.
- This follows the performance recommendation to initialize variables in the initialization list.
- All other reported issues are not addressed in this diff, as they are related to function parameters, member variables, and class definitions that need separate fixes or configuration.
